  • Parameters are temporarily variables that is used as a placeholder for a function expression.
  • Arguments is the value that is inputted when replacing the parameter of a function
  • Method is when we pass through an object or another function inside a function express 
  • You can pass in an argument or method while declaring a variable or console logging the input. Example below outputs the same results
  
  let myFavorite = triple;
  console.log(myFavorite(5));
  
  let myFavorite = triple(5);
  console.log(myFavorite);
  
  • When declaring a function input with a method, "function" does not have to be called before the function name. 
  • An object inside an object can be accessed by first calling the object followed as followed:
  • Object.object.property

  let dog = {
    name: 'Louie',
    age: 12,
    foods: {
      favorite: 'Pandesal',
      leastFavorite: 'Vegetables'
    },
    color: 'white',
    breed: 'chihuahua',
    miss: true,
    loveYou() {
      alert('so so much....')
    }
  } 
  
  console.log(dog.foods.leastFavorite);
  
  • The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
  First, we’ll take a look at the syntax of a typical if statement:
    if ( condition ) {
  value if true;
  } else {
  value if false;
  }
  Now, the ternary operator:
  condition ? value if true : value if false

JavaScript has a number of built-in object types, such as:

Math, Date, Object, Function, Boolean, Symbol, Array, Map, Set, Promise, JSON, etc.

These objects are sometimes referred to as "native objects".

Constructor functions, commonly referred to as just "constructors", are special functions that allow us to build instances of these built-in native objects. All the constructors are capitalized.
To use a constructor function, It must prepend it with the operator new.

Besides constructor functions for the built-in objects, I can also define custom constructor functions.

Instantiate means to create an instance of a new object in memory.
**new does 4 things**

1. Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object.
2. Adds a property to the new object (__proto__) that links to the constructor function's prototype object
3. Binds the newly created object instance as the this context (i.e. all references to this in the constructor function now refer to the object created in the first step).
4. Returns "this" if the function doesn't return an object.

 inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction  and polymorphism

 In JavaScript classes, super is used to specify what property gets inherited from the super-class in the sub-class.

An empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:

let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax 

let user = {     // an object
  name: "John",  // by key "name" : store value "John"
  age: 30        // by key "age" : store value 30
};

*Properties has a key (also known as 'name' or 'identifier'). The values are defined after the 'colon' and can be accessed by either dot or bracket notation. The value can be of any type. 
*delete keyword is an operator that can be used to remove a property.
*property names can have multiple words but must be quoted. 
*Last property value may end with a comma (trailing or hanging comma)
*Multiword properties does not work with dot notations. The dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier.(contains no spaces, doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special characters ($ and _ are allowed).
*We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That’s called computed properties.

/* let fruit = prompt("which fruit to buy", "apple?");

let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5 //name of property is taken from variable above
};

alert(bag.apple);*/

let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

// take property name from the fruit variable
bag[fruit] = 5;

/*let fruit = 'apple';
let bag = {
  [fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5
};*/ 

In real code, we often use existing variables as values for property names.

For instance:

function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    // ...other properties
  };
}

let user = makeUser("John", 30);
alert(user.name); // John
In the example above, properties have the same names as variables. The use-case of making a property from a variable is so common, that there’s a special property value shorthand to make it shorter.

Property value shorthand. Both normal and shorthand properties can be in the same object. Object property names has no restrictions. Example, 'for', 'let', 'return', etc. There are no limitations  however it will automatically be converted to a string. (eg 0 becomes '0') The only exception is __proto__. We can’t set it to a non-object value:

Instead of name:name we can just write name, like this:

function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name, // same as name: name
    age,  // same as age: age
    // ...
  };

   literal notation (initiliazer notation) = common declaration using curly brackets

 Key value pair is a property name , seperated by a colon , and then a value. The property can
 be enclosed in quotation marks but not necessary as Javascript interprets it as a string. This will not apply
 to multi worded key names , in which quotes are needed .This practice should be avoided however and should be written as camelCase. 
 Console.log() is also an example of a "dot notation" The console is an object and the 'log' is it's property. console.log(typeof console);    // -> object --- console.log(typeof console.log);    // -> function

 If the property of an object is another object that has properties itself, this is called a nested property. 
 It's possible to add another property to an existing object by simply adding in another dot along with it's key values. 

 The property of an object can also be a function. A function that is the property of an object will be called a method. Just as the properties of objects describe their characteristics, methods can be treated as their characteristic behavior, or ways of changing the state of an object.

 Assigining an object with an empty new property returns an undefined typeof, rather than a not or null. This is also true when initiating a variable to an empty object.

 Bracket notations [] is useful for calculating expressions and also for multi worded keys. Example below:

 let contact = {
    "first name": "Ronald"
};
contact["first name"] = "Tim"; PASSED (bracket notation)
contact.first name = "Tim"; // FAILED (dot notation)
contact."first name" = "Tim";  FAILED (dot notation)

Default parameters is a way to build a function without passing in any arguments. Without a default parameter, a function with now throw an error code, however it would return back a NaN result (non-sensible output)

    (OOP Demo Chart)
      Animal
  Cat         Bird
HouseCat     Tiger      Parot


There are two keywords that are essential in OOP. These are 'extends' and 'super'. 

Extends keyword allows to inheritance from an exisiting class 
Super keyword allows  to "borrow" fucntionality from a super class, in a sub class.

Animal class = constructor (color & energy)
Animal class prototype = 3 methods isActive(), sleep(), getColor()

*The isActive() method, whenever ran, will lower the value of energy until it hits 0. The isActive() method will also report the updated value of energy. If energy is at zero, the animal object will immediately go to sleep, by invoking the sleep() method based on the said condition. 

*The Cat class will inherit from Animal, with the additional sound, canJumpHigh, and canClimbTrees properties specific to the Cat class. It will also have its own makeSound() method. 

*The Bird class will also inherit from Animal, but is own specific properties will be quite different from Cat. Namely, the Bird class will have the sound and the canFly properties, and the makeSound method too. 

*The HouseCat class will extend the Cat class, and it will have its own houseCatSound as its special property. Additionally, it will override the makeSound() method from the Cat class, but it will do so in an interesting way. If the makeSound() method, on invocation, receives a single option argument - set to true, then it will run super.makeSound() - in other words, run the code from the parent class (Cat) with the addition of running the console.log(this.houseCatSound). Effectively, this means that the makeSound() method on the HouseCat class' instance object will have two separate behaviors, based on whether we pass it true or false. 

*The Tiger class will also inherit from Cat, and it will come with its own tigerSound property, while the rest of the behavior will be pretty much the same as in the HouseCat class. 

*. Finally, the Parrot class will extend the Bird class, with its own canTalk property, and its own makeSound() method, working with two conditionals: one that checks if the value of true was passed to makeSound during invocation, and another that checks the value stored inside this.canTalk property.  

Note: If I didn't use the super keyword in our sub-classes, once I'd run the above code, I'd get the following error: Uncaught ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor.
