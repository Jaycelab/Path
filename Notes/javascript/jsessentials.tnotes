a conjunction, i.e. logical AND (&& symbol)
an alternative, i.e. logical OR (symbol ||)
a negation, i.e. logical NOT (symbol !)

The negation operator is an unary, and it changes the logical value of the operand to its opposite, that is, false to true, and true to false. 

The highest priority is negation !, then conjunction &&, and finally the alternative ||. The precedence can of course be changed by means of parentheses.
