- Like CSS, you can manually select child elements by using element child( eg document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild )
- .innerHTML returns the original element and modifies after = operator
.querySelector looks inside the ENTIRE document for a 'selector' (or id,class)
- objects inside the DOM can have both properties and methods.
- Properties describe something about the object.
- Methods are things that the object can do
