-- The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted since it depends on a number of factors:

- Languange used to implement the algorithm
- Computer the program runs on
- Other programs running simultaneously
- Qualty of the operating system 

We evaluate the performance of an alogorithm in terms of its input size

- Time complexity: Amount of time taken to run as a function of input size
- Space complexity - Amount of memory to run as a function of input size
