= Grid-template can be used as a shortcut for grid-template-rows/columns. The value is written as row / column. 
- The direction of grid can be reflected as a "L" shaped. You begin from the top left to bottom right. 
- Grid-column start/end can be shorted with just grid-column with a value of "num / num"
- Span can also be replaced by adding a value after span , which is the number of rows/columns to span 
- You can use a negative value to target the last column line if you don't know how many columns you will have
